# Pre-course study material

This file contains some material and exercises that will help prepare you for the DDD course.

You do not need to hand in anything for this pre-study assignment, and you will not be assessed on them. This is just to give you a head start on the topics.

Before starting, please ensure your development environment is set up (see the main [README](README.md))

Any questions, please contact me at `scott(at)scottwlaschin.com`

## 1. Check that you can run F#

We will be using F# as our development language. No prior experience with F# is needed -- these pre-study materials will cover the basics of using F# and I will explain everything else as we need it.

See the main [README](README.md) for installation instructions.

## 2. Open up the "prestudy" folder

Once you can run "hello world", the next step is to open up the folder with the pre-study exercises.

First, open up the code examples:
* In VS Code, open the `/src/0-prestudy` folder
* In VisualStudio or JetBrains Rider, open the project/subdirectory called `0-prestudy`

---

## 3. Work through the exercises

Next, open the files in the pre-study folder called `01-Exercises.txt`, `02-Exercises.txt` etc., and work through them.

Any questions, or if you see a mistake, please contact me at `scott(at)scottwlaschin.com`

We will be briefly going over these exercises during the class, so you will have an opportunity to ask questions then as well.
