// Designing Noughts And Crosses
// ================================

For this exercise, come up with a design for playing "Noughts And Crosses" aka "Tic-Tac-Toe".
I chose this because it's simple and everybody knows the rules.

As always, there are no "right" answers -- I am interested in seeing different approaches. We will be discussing these answers in the first session of the course.

# 1. Write down a "design" for playing Noughts And Crosses

[answer in a few paragraphs, up to a page -- don't go into too much detail. No code allowed!]

# 2. How is your design different from code?

[answer briefly here]
