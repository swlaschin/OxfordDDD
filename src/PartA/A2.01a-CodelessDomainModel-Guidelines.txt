## Guidelines for Domain Modeling Exercise

In this part of the workshop, each team will pick a domain
and then collaborate on building a shared mental model and documenting the domain.

* One person takes the role of domain expert
* One person takes the role of main interviewer (although everyone can ask questions)
* One person documents the domain (although everyone can contribute)

The interviewer(s) will ask the domain expert questions in order to
understand the domain and become domain experts themselves.

The goal is to:
* Document the domain using AND and OR, etc
* And at the same time, develop a shared mental model
  and shared language among the group

Possible domains to use:
* ATM/Cash Machine
* Microwave oven
* Self-service espresso/cappuccino machine
* Delivery tracking service (e.g Fedex/DHL)
* Your own domain that you are an expert in



===================
How to interview
===================

* Listen to and learn from the experts
  * Don't impose your own ideas
  * Avoid yes/no questions
  * If you hear "it depends", drill deeper
* Disagreement between experts is OK.
  * The design process is about getting everyone on the same page!
* Everyone must be in the room
  * Otherwise they miss being part of the process.
    It's not just about the results!

===================
How to model a domain
===================

* Pick one workflow to focus on.
  When that is done, do another one

===================
How to model a workflow
===================

* What is needed for the workflow input?
  * What data is from the triggering event itself
  * What data is from the current state of the system? E.g. loaded from storage?
  * What other data is needed?
* What is the output of the workflow?
  * What events are needed for broadcast to downstream systems?
  * What data should be saved to storage?
* How does the state of the system change?
  * Does data need to be loaded, changed, and resaved?
* What are the side effects? (Things that must be done but are internal to the domain)

====================
"Place order" Example
====================

Workflow: "Place order"
triggered by:
  OrderReceived event
input:
  Order (from the triggering event)
  ProductCatalog  (to lookup prices)
output:
  OrderPlaced event (to be sent to downstream systems)
  The final PlacedOrder (to store in the database)
  An OrderAcknowledgment (to be sent to the customer)

---------------------------
Document the data with "AND"
---------------------------

data Order =
  CustomerInfo
  AND ShippingAddress
  AND BillingAddress
  AND list of OrderLines
  AND AmountToBill

data OrderLine =
  Product
  AND OrderQuantity
  AND Price

data CustomerInfo = CustomerName AND ContactInfo
data CustomerName = FirstName AND LastName

data BillingAddress = ??? // don't know yet



---------------------------
Document choices with OR
---------------------------

data OrderQuantity =
  UnitQuantity
  OR KilogramQuantity

data ContactInfo =
  EmailAddress
  OR PhoneNumber

---------------------------
Document simple/constrained types
---------------------------

data UnitQuantity = integer between 1 and ?
data KilogramQuantity = decimal between ? and ?

data EmailAddress = non empty string containing an @ symbol
data PhoneNumber = non empty string containing only digits, hyphens, and spaces
