## Topics covered in this session

### A1 DDD and Domain modelling

* Discussion of the software development process, and where requirements, analysis and design fit in.
* Why do so many software projects fail: bad requirements or bad code?
* Why is communication so important? How can we improve communication and feedback loops?
* What is domain-driven design and how does it differ from object-oriented design and database-driven design?
* How to document a sketch of the design in real-time with rapid feedback.

### A2. Domain Modelling in Practice

* Eventstorming
* Bounded contexts and ubiquitous language
* Codeless domain model
  * Documenting the model with AND and OR
* Documenting the model with types
  * Introduction to algebraic types and function types.
  * Using algebraic types and function types to document the nouns and verbs in the domain.
