// =================================
// Exercise: Context maps
// =================================


Here is a description of some bounded contexts and their relationships.
Turn this into a context map!

* Look at the other context maps in this folder to see what the syntax is.
* And check the reference at https://contextmapper.org/docs/context-map/

IMPORTANT: Do use the following annotations if applicable:

* SK - Shared kernel
• CF - Conformist (supplier driven)
• C/S - Consumer driven (Customer/Supplier) - put a C on the customer/consumer side and S on the supplier side
• ACL - Anti corruption layer  (protect from another domain language "corrupting" your domain)

Don't worry about all the other annotations available at that site! Too complicated!

Domain: e-commerce startup
======================================

A e-commerce startup is being built.
Some of the things they need to do are:

* Process payments using a third party payment processor
* Deliver items using a third party fulfillment service
* Send emails to customers using a third party email service

Exercise: Create a context map for this domain

Answer:

ContextMap ECommerceStartup {
  contains ECommerceStartup
  contains ThirdPartyPaymentProcessor
  contains ThirdPartyFulfillmentSystem
  contains ThirdPartyEmailService

  ECommerceStartup [ACL] <- ThirdPartyPaymentProcessor
  ECommerceStartup [ACL] <- ThirdPartyFulfillmentSystem
  ECommerceStartup [ACL] <- ThirdPartyEmailService
}

Domain: conference organizing
======================================

A conference organizer is putting on a conference.
Some of the things they need to do are:

* They have their own internal system for tracking the attendees
* Book hotels for attendees using a third party hotel reservation service such as booking.com
* Book flights for attendees using a third party airline reservation service such as SABRE
* They need a website and have outsourced the building of this to a contractor. But they collaborate on the design
* The internal system also sends data to a reporting system tool using the reporting system's API

Exercise: Create a context map for this domain

Answer:

ContextMap ConferencePlanning {
  contains ConferencePlanner
  contains HotelReservationSystem
  contains AirlineReservationSystem
  contains Website
  contains ReportingSystem

  ConferencePlanner [ACL,CF?] <- HotelReservationSystem
  ConferencePlanner [ACL,CF?] <- AirlineReservationSystem
  ConferencePlanner [SK] <-> [SK] Website
  ConferencePlanner [CF] <-> ReportingSystem
}

Note:
    building the website could also be done as consumer driven like this:
        ConferencePlanner[C] <- [S] Website
