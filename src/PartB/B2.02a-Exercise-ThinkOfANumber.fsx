Subtract the number you first thought of.
The answer is TWO!

Challenge, write this using a piping model.
Use the code below as a starting point

// uncomment this code to start
// by removing (* and *)

let thinkOfANumber numberYouThoughtOf =
    let addOne x = x + 1
    let squareIt x = ??
    let subtractOne x = ??
    let divideByTheNumberYouFirstThoughtOf x = ??
    let subtractTheNumberYouFirstThoughtOf x = ??

    // define these functions
    // then combine them using piping

// what happens if you use a very large number?
