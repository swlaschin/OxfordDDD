## Topics covered in this session

### B1: Domain Modelling with Types

* Different approaches to modeling a domain:
    * Transaction script
    * Database-centric
    * Behaviour-oriented (aka object-oriented)
    * Pipeline-oriented (aka functional)
* Interlude: UML
* Interlude: Circular dependencies are evil

### B2: Pipeline oriented programming

* Modelling workflows with functions and function composition. Comparison of FP with OO equivalent (request/response vs. input/output)
* Practice: Solving some simple challenges using function composition and pipelines

### B3: Pipelines vs Behaviour (FP vs OO)

* Comparison of FP with OO equivalent (request/response vs. input/output)
* Practice: Solving some simple designs using both OO and FP
