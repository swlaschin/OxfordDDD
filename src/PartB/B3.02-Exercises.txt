// =================================
// Exercise 2: Student Enrolment
// =================================

-------------------------------
Requirements
-------------------------------

A Student has a StudentId
A Student can enrol for zero or more Courses
As part of the enrolment process the eligibility of the Student is checked
A successful enrolment is called a Enrolment

A Course has a CourseId
A Course can contain zero or more Students (up to a maximum, different for each Course)

Each Course is assigned a Teacher
A Teacher can be assigned to zero or more Courses, up to a maximum (per Teacher)

At the end of the term, the Student is given a Grade (one of 5,4,3,2,Fail=0) for the Course

The student can calculate their Grade Point Average (GPA)
by averaging all the grades given for all their Enrollments.

The teacher and administrators can calculate the Grade Point Average (GPA) of a particular Course
by averaging all the grades for the enrollments in that Course.

Exercises
-------------------------------

Design using a OO/behaviour approach first
* B3.02a-StudentEnrolmentOO.fsx

Design using a functional/type approach next
* B3.02c-StudentEnrolmentFP.fsx

// =================================
// Got extra time?
// =================================

Add a new requirement:

* There are two types of Students now: Regular and Auditor
* An Auditor ("listener") can enrol in a Course like a Regular student
  BUT they are not graded, and they are excluded from the GPA calculations.
