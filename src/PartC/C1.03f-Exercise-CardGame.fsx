// ================================================
// Exercise: Model a card game
//
// IMPORTANT: This is NOT a "rec" module, so the types will need to be in order of declaration!
// ================================================

(*
The domain model is:

* A card is
  * a combination of a Suit (Heart, Spade) and a Rank (Two, Three, ... King, Ace)
  * OR a Joker
* A hand is a list of cards
* A deck is a list of cards
* A shuffled deck is also a list of cards, but different from a normal deck
* A player has a name and a hand
* A game consists of a deck and list of players

Actions:
* To deal, remove a card from a shuffled deck and put it on the table
* To pick up a card, add a card to a hand
* To shuffle, start with a normal deck and create a shuffled deck from it

Exercise:
* 1. Define types to represent the domain data and actions
* 2. (optional) Implement any functions that you can (look at the answer file if you get stuck)
