# Part C: Refining the domain

1. Topics covered in this session
2. Extra material and references

## Topics covered in this session

###  Using types to model the domain better

* Using types to capture constraints and why primitive types should be avoided
* Using optional types instead of null for missing values
* Using sum types to replace booleans and eliminate impossible states.
* Refactoring towards greater insight: how domain specific types can lead to clearer designs, less defensive programming, and fewer potential errors
* Making contracts explicit: Total functions
* Practice: exercises in the concepts above will be interspersed with the discussions

### Identity

* Identity: entities vs. value objects.
* Aggregates
* Integrity and Consistency in the Domain
